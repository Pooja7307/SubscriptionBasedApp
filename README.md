# SubscriptionBasedApp
This is a subscription-based content access web application where users can register, log in, choose a subscription plan (Basic, Standard, or Premium), and access content based on their subscription level. The application is built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, while the frontend is designed with HTML and CSS templating.
